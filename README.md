# TFM
This repository will store a clean version of the code used to obtain the results of the TFM "Graph Convolutional Networks for Human Identification Based on Multichannel ECG Signals".

The code contains:

* The installation of different packages in case you want to run in google colab.
* The definition of several useful functions to work with ECG Signals in graph form.
* the definition of different exmaple models.
* A generic example of how to load the data.
* The code needed to train the models and extract the different metrics.
